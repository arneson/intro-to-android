# Example projects

In the folder example_projects you will find four sample projects.

### FirstApp & NavigationExample

The two projects from the first tutorial.

### RecyclerExample

The (not code standard wise perfect) recyclerview project I live coded during the second session.

### CoinBrowser

The third project I added is written in kotlin and demonstrates fetching data from an API, in this case cryptocompare, and showing a grid of digital currencies.
Using:

- retrofit for http requests
- rxjava for reactive programming support
- glide for image loading

### More complex, pretty java-heavy. Databases, network etc.
